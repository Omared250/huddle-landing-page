### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Design

You all can find the preview of the page in the Design folder, where you can guide yourself about how you want that your page looks like.

### Links

- Repository URL: https://github.com/Omared250/huddle-landing-page
- Live Site URL: https://single-price-grid-component-lime-two.vercel.app/

## My process

My first step was to build the project base by creating the folder that stores the css style, the folder that stores the images and create the html file. After this, 
I proceeded to create a local git repository to save the versions of my project. I link it with a remote github repository to be able to update my project on the web 
and then I started to configure my project at the html and css level.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS flex and more about HTML5

I am very happy with this trip because I did not know that the world of code was so big and interesting, I have to say thanks to freecodecamp because from them I got
the inspiration to start with all this and I really recommend that website for people like me who want to change their life and want to do something
that they really enjoy.
